# HTML5 - demoscene 

## Overview

My recent discovery is that beloved demoscene lives on! Not only on PC but also on more challenging platform like web browser! 
That said, this time I am really determined to get into demo/effects programming in my free time.

## THREE
Looking at the existing demos I've found out that there a [THREE library](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html) is wildly used. The library provides a building blocks for 3D graphics.
Check out the documentation

## Structure
To create a tidy structure of there are following:
```
+-- js
|   +-- cube.js    // cube related functions
|   +-- camera.js  // camera related functions
|   +-- three.js   // THREE library 
+-- cubes.html // effect name
+-- fancy.html // effect name
